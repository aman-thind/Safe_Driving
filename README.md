Objective: Predicting likelihood of an individual to file an insurance claim within one year of subscription.

A model that would improve the Auto insurance signup process by predicting the likelihood of a policy holder to file a claim within one year of taking a policy. This would also help to ensure the right premium is charged based on the policy holder driving history rather than only the location of the holder. By using a Classification method which classifies the Policy holder’s likelihood to process a claim into two classes which represents if there would be a claim or not based on independent variables pertinent to each holder’s history.

## Dataset

The French Motor claims dataset is obtained from Kaggle. This raw dataset contains 11 columns with independent variables which represents the insured personal details required for signup and a dependent variable which contains claims history for classifying the correlation of the independent variables into binary classes of 1 or 0, representing if the insured had processed a claim or not.
